## Yummly Party Planner

Have you ever planned a party for your friends and then realized you don't know what to make? Or opened the freezer up and wondered what are we having for dinner? Meal planning is a great way to avoid that frustration of never knowing what to have. It can also feel like you’re eating the same meals, this makes meal planning, feel redundant.

This is a fun way using the Yummly API. Yummly has thousands of recipes, it’s easy to find something new and yummy every night of the week!
